# <span id='feature-gettingStarted'>  Getting Started <span>

## <span id='feature-install'> Installing and Launching TutorsContactsPro <span>

### Step 1: Install Java

Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer. If you don't have Java installed, follow the instructions in [Appendix A: Installing Java](#appendix-a-installing-java).

### Step 2: Download

Download the latest `[CS2103T-W10-4][TutorsContactsPro].jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/releases).

### Step 3: Set up TutorsContactsPro Home Folder

Copy or move the downloaded `[CS2103T-W10-4][TutorsContactsPro].jar` file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TutorsContactsPro.

### Step 4: Launch TutorsContactsPro

1. Open a terminal (MacOS) or command prompt (Windows).

2. Navigate to the folder where you placed the `[CS2103T-W10-4][TutorsContactsPro].jar` file using the `cd` command. For example, John Doe has his `[CS2103T-W10-4][TutorsContactsPro].jar` file in `/Users/JohnDoe/Desktop/TutorsContactsPro`, so he'll run:

    ```bash
    cd /Users/JohnDoe/Desktop/TutorsContactsPro
    ```

3. If you are using terminal, verify that your working directory contains `[CS2103T-W10-4][TutorsContactsPro].jar` by using the `ls` command. 
Else if you are using command prompt, verify that your working directory contains `[CS2103T-W10-4][TutorsContactsPro].jar` by using the `dir` command.
You should see `TutorsContactsPro.jar` in the list of files printed. Here's what our John Doe got when running this command.

    ```bash
    JohnDoe@johndoe TutorsContactsPro % ls
    TutorsContactsPro.jar
    ```
4. Once your terminal's working directory is the folder that contains `[CS2103T-W10-4][TutorsContactsPro].jar`, run the following command to launch TutorsContactsPro:

    ```bash 
    java -jar TutorsContactsPro.jar
    ```

   After executing this command, a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to the one below should appear shortly:

> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `TUT04 LAB05` will match all students in `TUT04` and/or `LAB05`.
> * Only student's group name is searched.
> * The group name KEYWORD provided must be an existing group in TutorsContactsPro for students to be filtered accurately. 
> * When a non-existing group name is provided, TutorsContactsPro will display the status message '0 students listed!'. 

Examples:
* `filter LAB10` returns only `Kendra Huetta` belonging to group `LAB10`.
* `filter TUT04` returns `John Doe` and `Johan Louis` belonging to group `TUT04` as shown in the image below.

### Saving the data

TutorsContactsPro data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TutorsContactsPro data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

[//]: # (<box type="warning" seamless>)

> **⚠️ Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TutorsContactsPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TutorsContactsPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## <span id='feature-faq'> FAQ <span>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TutorsContactsPro home folder.

[Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <span id='feature-issues'> Known issues <span>

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

[Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <span id='feature-enhancements'> Planned Enhancements <span> 
Given below are the planned future enhancements for the application.

1. **Improve add feature**: Currently, TutorContactsPro allows the addition of students with the same exact details and names but different case for names which can be misleading. This can result in addition of duplicate students instead. Hence, we plan to improve the `add` feature to detect whether students added have completely similar details regardless of casing and throw a duplicate student added warning where appropriate.

2. **Allow the display of Telegram invite link**: TutorsContactsPro currently only allows the assignment of the Telegram invite link to a specific group via the `editgroup` command which is not too informative. We plan to improve the interface to include a field to display the Telegram invite link assigned for each specific group.

3. **Improve the group tabs**: After marking the attendance in a particular group tab, TutorsContactsPro currently will automatically direct users to the results tab which can result in inconvenience for users. We plan to improve the group tabs interface such that users will still be able to remain on their selected group tab aftering executing any commands.

4. **Improve add Telegram link feature**: Currently, TutorsContactsPro only allows the assignment of a Telegram invite link to a specific group via the `editgroup` command which may not be very intuitive for users. We plan to improve this feature by combining it with the `addgroup` feature to allow addition of a group together with the Telegram invite link.

5. **Add unmark attendance feature**: TutorsContactsPro currently allows TA users to mark the attendance for a particular student which can be inconvenient when users make a mistake marking the attendance and they are unable to undo it. Therefore, in the future, we plan to include an additional unmark attendance feature for a specified student.

6. **Improve generation of email template command**: The current `mail` command only takes in the `GROUP_NAME` input with no prefixes whereas the `mailtg` command takes in a `g/` prefix with a `GROUP_NAME` input. The difference in the command format for these two closely related commands can make it complex for users. Therefore, we plan to simplify and standardise the command input for `mail` and `mailtg` to be `g/GROUP_NAME`.

7. **Improve generation of email template command**: When executing mail, mailtg command with an invalid group, including an non-existing group, empty group and group without Telegram invite link. TutorsContactsPro currently does not display a warning for users. We plan to improve them such that a warning message will be displayed when the input provided is invalid.

8. **Make filter feature error message more specific**: When filtered with a non-existing group, the current error message displays `0 students listed!` which is too general. We plan to use `filter` command to check whether the `GROUP_NAME` provided is an existing group. The error message will then also mention the reason for failing to filter any students: `Group does not exist, 0 students listed!`
